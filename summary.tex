    I am a craftsman $https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship$

    With fifteen years of experience building quality sofwtare, I
    have developped expertise on how to accelerate feature development
    to build bug-free software that customers and developers trust.

    I am a software generalist with a focus on (overall) quality and
    security..

    One difference between a smart programmer and a professional
    programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is
    king. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that
    others can understand. -- Clean Code

    Small sample of key practices I value: focus on user
    experience, testing, types, continuous integration, good naming,
    micro code, clean interfaces and layers of abstration, advanced
    source-control.
    Peer reviews, communication, fresh pair of eyes, feedback culture, team health
    monitoring.
    Try things, get feedback, iterate.

    I will make you think be asking lots of questions.

    I have strong opinions, but they are always loosely held.

    You can't have an option position and decide to hire me for it. I very probably won't fit in that box. You'll want to talk with me, come to the conclusion that I'm talented and special, and find a role for me.
