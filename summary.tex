    ... : doubt, ask questions,


    With over ten years of experience building quality sofwtare, I
    have developped expertise on how to accelerate feature development
    to build bug-free software that customers and developers trust.

    Small sample of key practices I value: focus on user
    experience, testing, types, continuous integration, good naming,
    micro code, clean interfaces and layers of abstration, advanced
    source-control.
    Peer reviews, communication, feedback culture, team health
    monitoring.
    Try things, get feedback, iterate.

    I will make you think be asking lots of questions.

    You can't have an option position and decide to hire me for it. I very probably won't fit in that box. You'll want to talk with me, come to the conclusion that I'm talented and special, and find a role for me.
