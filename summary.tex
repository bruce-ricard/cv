    With over ten years of experience building quality sofwtare,
    I have developped expertise on how to reduce code debt and
    accelerate feature development to build bug-free software that
    customers and developers trust.

    Small sample of key practices I value:

    Clean interfaces and layers of abstraction, micro-code, naming,
    testing, types, continuous integration, advanced source-control.

    Peer reviews, communication, feedback, team health.

    Try things, get feedback, iterate. ab testing
