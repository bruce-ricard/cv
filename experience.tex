 Six-month internship at Paris VI computer science laboratory;
 algebraic geometry and symbolic computation
  \entry*[\color{ForestGreen} Paris, France]
  Required excellent knowledge of math and algorithmic for optimizing
  computation time, due to the double exponential complexity of the
  algorithm in the degree of the polynomials ($O(2^{2^d})$)
